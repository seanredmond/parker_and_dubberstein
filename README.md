# Parker and Dubberstein's Babylonian Chronology


In their _Babylonian Chronology 626 B. C.- A.D. 45._, Richard Parker and Waldo Dubberstein published tables of the calculated dates of visible new moons and the Babylonian months and years they corresponded to, as well as intercalations made to keep their [lunisolar calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_calendar) aligned with the seasons.

This calendar became the foundation of many other calendars in the ancient Mediterranean, such as those [used by Greeks](https://github.com/seanredmond/heniautos) as well the Jewish and Islamic calendars still in use today. Parker and Dubberstein's work is also still in use as a convenient source of ancient astronomical data (so it seems useful to have a machine-readable version).
